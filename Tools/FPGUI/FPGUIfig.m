function varargout = FPGUIfig(varargin)
% FPGUIFIG MATLAB code for FPGUIfig.fig
% 
% Please note this file will stay empty and will not be used
%
%      FPGUIFIG, by itself, creates a new FPGUIFIG or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = FPGUIFIG returns the handle to a new FPGUIFIG or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      FPGUIFIG('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in FPGUIFIG.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      FPGUIFIG('Property','Value',...) creates a new FPGUIFIG or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before FPGUIfig_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to FPGUIfig_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
